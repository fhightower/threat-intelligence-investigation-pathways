# Hosts

Hosts, like `example.org` or `test.example.org`, are one of the more central types of threat data primarily because they are so prevalent. To highlight a few uses for hosts, they can be used as a callback for a malicious file, a phishing page to steal credentials, or a neutral site from which a malicious file gets information (like the current date/time, its current IP address, etc.).
