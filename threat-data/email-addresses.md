# Email Addresses

An email address, like `badguy@example.org`, is an interesting type of threat data because an email address allows communication between multiple parties and is often used as an identifier/username for websites. This means that email addresses can be used to deliver a malicious file, register a domain, or communicate between bad guys who are working together, just to name a few possible uses.
